Hint
Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that is a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.

CODE:

class Solution {
    public List<String> stringMatching(String[] words) {
        int i,j,z,k;
        int len=words.length;
        List<String> q=new ArrayList<>();
        for(i=0;i<len;i++){
            for(j=0;j<len;j++){
    
                if(i!=j && words[i].contains(words[j])){
                    if(q.contains(words[j])){
                        q.add(null);
                    }
                    else{
                        q.add(words[j]);
                    }
                    
                     
                }
                q.remove(null);
            }
      }
      
      return q;
    }
}
